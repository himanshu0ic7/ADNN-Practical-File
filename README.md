Sno. Experiment Name 
1) To develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 
accurate classification of images into two distinct categories, 
utilizing data augmentation techniques and regularization to 
improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.

2) To generate musical notes using a Recurrent Neural Network 
(RNN) trained on the MAESTRO dataset, where the model 
predicts the next note in a sequence based on previous notes, 
enabling the creation of new music compositions

3) To build and train an (Autoencoder model) that can learn to 
encode and decode images, particularly by denoising noisy 
MNIST images through reconstruction

4) To implement the (U-Net) architecture for performing image 
segmentation on a pet dataset, where each image is segmented to 
identify specific regions, such as the pet's body or background.

5) To implement a (GAN) for generating realistic data by training a 
generator and discriminator in a competitive framework.

6) To implement real-time object detection using (YOLOv3) 
architecture with TensorFlow 2.0 for efficient and accurate 
identification of objects in images and videos.

7) To perform image classification task using Vision 
Transformer(viT) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

8) To perform text generation using (transformers), leveraging their 
ability to model sequential data and generate coherent, context 
aware text outputs
